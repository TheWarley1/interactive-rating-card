It's been a while since I made a journal entry on my projects. 
I proceeded to the JS section of my course, and my web3bridge bootcamp also got to js in the course outline. 
I must say Js IS Testing. in  all of this, i completed my js section of my course, solved some js challenges and quizes on freecodecamp and other sites. read ebenezer Don's JS for vips.
Finnally GGs. I just need to keep practicing more.
